Variables : its nothing but container  which store different kinds datatypes 
 datatypes :values -string ,boolean numbers arrays etc 

Declaration :creation of Variables,function class  etc..
 var a;
 a: identifier :

Rules For Writing/declaring the varaible/function Names (identifier)
1.it shouldnot  contain special charater except $ and _
2.it shouldnot start with numbers 
3.it should not reserved keyword (function ,for ,var let const )
4.it shouldnot white space (full name❌) -->full_name -->fullName 

different ways Declare in js 
1.use var keyword--->1995 
2.use let keyword --->es6 (2015)
3.use const keyword --->es6 (2015)
4.without any keyword -->global


REDEClARATION : creation of varaible with same Name with in the same scope ;
var a;
var a;
INITIALAZATION : assiging a value at time of  creation/Declaration or after creation 

scope: lifetime of varaible (accessibility of varaible) 
 different types of scope : 
    global scope : it accessible everywhere with in code 
    local scope : 
       block_scope : {}
       function scope : function example(){}
       module scope : the code in one file can accessble within other js files 


HOISTING : moving all Declaration to top of there scope 
hoisting is a behavior where declarations of variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope before the code is executed.


Temporal Dead Zone:
This is the period from the start of a scope until the let or const declaration is reached during execution. In the TDZ, you cannot access the variable, even though it's "known" to exist by the JavaScript engine. 

Modules :
 
 Types of modules :
        common js module :  (before ) 
             require("module-library/name") //eg : react redux bootstrap-icons fonts   //using the code
             exports.filename/module //sharing the code 
        Esm : 
            import  module from "module-library"  // using the code 
            export modulename  //sharing the code  


            Types of Exports and Imports 
              Types of Exports 
                Named export : we need to give the same function varaible ,object etc  where ever using(importing) it
                         named export can n for a file  

                         ex: export var a=10
                         ex: export var b=10

                 default exports : we can  import with any name  
                                default export should one for file 
                           ex: export default var c=20
                  Types of Imports 
                     Named imports  : we need to import with same name
                      import {a,b} from "./filename"
                     default Imports : we can import with any name 
                      import cvalue from "./filename"

Arrays :  it is collection/group of values undersingle varaible name 
different ways we can create arrays 
1.using array literals :[]
2.using the Array global keyword
3.using the New keyword (array constructor method)


useCase : dynamic Data( collection productsinfo) ,login systems ,search functions authentication 

Basic methods 
pop : removes last element
push : adds elements to last 
shift : removes first element
unshift :adds elements to first  
slice : extracts the section of array -->  100->20  slice(0,20)
splice :it adds and reomves the elements from an arrays 
indexof : returns index of given search-element 
lastindex :returns index of given search-element  (but search operation takes from last)
includes: it returns true or false values based on search element 

Higher Order methods 
**map()----->list & keys in react
filter() ----->search functionality,filters 
reduce()---> eccomerce apps ,calculator 
foreach()
sort()---> prices from low to high to low
find() ----
findindex()
reverse()


Functions : its is a block of code which perfoms specific tasks
functions are building block of any apps
specific tasks: opening the popup ,clicking a button  ,adding items ,validating a user ,performing calculation

Readibilty
reuseablity: write once and use as many times we require 
modular & clean 


Diiferent types of Functions 
1.Named function 
2.arrow function
3.anonoumous function : function without name 
4.function expression
5.IFFE :IMmediately invoked function expression 
6.callback function
7.generator function


decalaration: creation of varaible function or class
function Data(){ 
   //code
}
//calling the function
Data()

🎯Parameters|params|formal arguments :(in react we call props) : these are varaibles passed in function decalaration
  types of paramaters
  1.default paramaters
  1.rest paramaters

🎯arguments | actual arguments :these are the values(any datatype) passed in function calling





 What is Callback Hell?
Callback Hell is a situation where multiple nested callbacks make code:

Hard to read

Hard to debug

Hard to maintain

Also called:

Pyramid of Doom

Arrow Anti-pattern
